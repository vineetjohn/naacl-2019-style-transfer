\section{Qualitative Examples}

Table~\ref{tab:transfer-samples} provides several examples of our style-transfer model.
Results show that we can successfully transfer the sentiment while preserving the content of a sentence.
We see that, with the empirically estimated style vector, we can reliably control the sentiment of generated sentences.

\section{Bag-of-Words (BoW) Vocabulary Ablation Tests}

The tests in Table \ref{tab:bow-vocab-ablation} demonstrate the effect of the choice of vocabulary used for the auxiliary content losses.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{| l || c | c | c | c || c |}
		\hline
		\tabc{1}{BoW Vocabulary}                         & \textbf{STA}   & \textbf{CS}    & \textbf{WO}    & \textbf{PPL} & \textbf{GM}   \\
		\hline \hline
		Full Corpus Vocabulary                           & 0.822          & 0.896          & 0.344          & \textbf{30}  & 0.21          \\ \hline
		Vocabulary without sentiment words               & 0.872          & 0.901          & 0.359          & \textbf{30}  & 0.22          \\ \hline
		Vocabulary without stopwords                     & 0.836          & 0.894          & 0.429          & 33           & 0.22          \\ \hline
		Vocabulary without stopwords and sentiment words & \textbf{0.934} & \textbf{0.904} & \textbf{0.473} & 32           & \textbf{0.24} \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Ablation tests on the BoW vocabulary.}
	\label{tab:bow-vocab-ablation}
\end{table}

It is evident that using a BoW vocabulary that excludes sentiment words and stopwords performs better overall.


\section{t-SNE plots of Ablation Tests}

Figure \ref{fig:only-rec} shows the t-SNE plots of the style and content embeddings, without any auxiliary losses.
Figures \ref{fig:rec-and-muls}, \ref{fig:rec-and-advs}, \ref{fig:rec-and-mulc} and \ref{fig:rec-and-advc} show the effect of adding each of the auxiliary losses independently.
